We caught up with 3/5 of The Hoagies playing at the very corporeal J.J.'s Corner Coffee House in Frederick Colorado and recorded a few great tunes. The second set opened with \"C'est Si Bon,\" popularized both by Louis Armstrong and Eartha Kitt. The music was written in 1947 by Henri Betti, the French lyrics by André Hornez, and the English lyrics by Jerry Seelen               Visit The Hoagies website at  hoagiesjoint.com  and watch for more guest appearances.

      "description": "    From  Wikipedia : The song was originally commissioned by Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Th&eacute;odore Robitaille for the 1880 Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day ceremony; Calixa Lavall&eacute;e composed the music, after which, words were written by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The lyrics were originally in French; an English version was created in 1906. Robert Stanley Weir wrote in 1908 another English version, which is the official and most popular version, one that is not a literal translation of the French. Weir's lyrics have been revised twice, taking their present form in 1980, but the French lyrics remain unaltered. \"O Canada\" had served as a de facto national anthem since 1939, officially becoming Canada's national anthem in 1980 when the Act of Parliament making it so received royal assent and became effective on July 1 as part of that year's Dominion Day (now known as Canada Day) celebrations.
